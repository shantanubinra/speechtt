Summarizing notes and obtaining a short and meaningful version of it is very important for any student, considering the time and effort required to understand the content in a better way. 
Lets consider tier-2 & tier-3 colleges,its become very hectic to listen to the faculty and make notes of what they are teaching in the class simultaneously .
When a student is absent in the class ,he eventually misses out the content of that class.
Due to lack of proper and short notes last time revision are not efficient.
